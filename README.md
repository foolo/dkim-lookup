# DKIM archive website

The website lets the user search for a domain and returns archived DKIM selectors and keys for that domain. Visit the website at https://archive.prove.email/

Under `/contribute`, users can contribute with new domains and selectors, which are extracted from the `DKIM-Signature` header field in each email message in the user's Gmail account.

When domains and selectors are added, the site fetches the DKIM key via DNS and stores it in the database.

For each record, the site also generates an on-chain proof with [Witness](https://witness.co), which functions as a data availability timestamp.

## Local development

```bash
cd dkim-lookup-app
pnpm install
```

Access to a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database is needed for development. See [below](#ubuntu_postgresql) for an example setup of PostgreSQL on Ubuntu.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the variables

Initialize the database from `schema.prisma`

```bash
pnpm prisma migrate deploy
```

Start the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Setting up a PostgreSQL database on Ubuntu

Install PostgreSQL server and client with `sudo apt install postgresql`

Log in with `sudo -u postgres psql` and set a password with `\password postgres`

Test the login: `psql postgresql://postgres:YOURPASSWORD@localhost`

Your `.env` config would now be:

```
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="postgresql://postgres:YOURPASSWORD@localhost/dkim_lookup"
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="postgresql://postgres:YOURPASSWORD@localhost/dkim_lookup"
```

## Unit tests

Run the unit tests

```bash
pnpm vitest --run
```

## Database management

Start the Prisma Studio database manager

```bash
pnpm prisma db studio
```

Resetting the database

```bash
pnpm prisma migrate reset
```

## Fetch DKIM keys from DNS and upload to database

The `update_records` script reads a list of domains and selectors, fetches the corresponding DKIM records via DNS lookup, and publishes the results to a database.

```bash
pnpm update_records domains_and_selectors.tsv
```

A TSV file with domains and selectors can be created with the [mbox selector scraper](../util/mbox_selector_scraper.py)
or with [Gmail Metadata Scraper](https://github.com/zkemail/selector-scraper)


## Batch updates

The API endpoint `/api/batch_update` is designed to be called at regular intervals, for example as a cron job.
The function updates the *N* oldest database records via DNS lookups.
Enable the feature by defining *N* through the `BATCH_UPDATE_NUM_RECORDS` environment variable.

To manually call `batch_update` on a local development server, run:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/batch_update -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"
```

To manually call `batch_update` on a production server on example.com, run:

```bash
curl https://example.com/api/batch_update -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"
```

## Domain search API

A public API endpoint for fetching keys for a certain domain is available at `https://archive.prove.email/api/domains/{domain_name}`. The response will contain a list of all known selectors and DKIM keys for `domain_name` and its subdomains.

An example call from the command line:

```bash
curl "https://archive.prove.email/api/domains/ethereum.org" | python -m json.tool
```

# Mbox selector scraper

The [mbox selector scraper](util/mbox_selector_scraper.py) tool allows for fetching domains and selectors from emails from any provider via the mbox format.

## Usage:

By using mbox as an intermediate format, it is possible to extract domains and selectors from email messages in any mail account.

### 1. Export email messages

#### a. From Gmail

Go to https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout and click **Deselect all**, then scroll down and select **Mail**, click **Next step**, and leave the default settings for the export format. When you click **Create export**, you will then get an email in the next few days with a link to download a .mbox file with all your email messages. Download it within 7 days to avoid expiration.

#### b. From Outlook

Go to https://outlook.live.com/mail/0/options/general/export/exportMailbox and click "Export Mailbox". It will say 'Status: Export in Progress", then you will get an email in the next few days with a download link to a .mbox file.

#### c. From other email providers

The easiest option is if your email provider's web client lets you export emails as an .mbox file.
You can then use that feature and continue with [parsing the mbox file](#mbox_extract).

If no such feature is available, an alternative is to connect your email account to a client such as Mozilla Thunderbird, Gnome Evolution or Microsoft Outlook, and use the export feature from within the email client.

### 2. Extract domains and selectors

When you have an .mbox file, use `mbox_selector_scraper.py` to extract the domains and selectors

Example:

```bash
util/mbox_selector_scraper.py my_mail.mbox > domains_and_selectors.tsv
```

The output file, (`domains_and_selectors.tsv` in this example), is a text file where each line contains a domain and a selector, separated by a tab character.
It should look something like this:

```
bandlab.com s1
dmd.idg.se  dmddkim
email.kiva.org  smtpapi
google.com  20230601
inet.se selector2
yahoo.com.au    s1024
domain_x	selector_x
domain_y	selector_y
domain_z	selector_z
...
```

You can now use the .tsv file on the [Upload from TSV file](https://archive.prove.email/upload_tsv) page.
